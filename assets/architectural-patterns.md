# TIER 3 -- Architectural patterns (system topology)

A Tier-3 pattern names the SYSTEM SHAPE of a non-trivial agentic
capability. Each composes several Tier-2 design patterns plus
substrate primitives. They are the AI-native equivalents of classical
architectural patterns (Layered, Pipes-and-Filters, Microservices,
Saga, Event-Driven) -- the macro shapes a Tier-2 pattern alone cannot
express.

When you recognize a Tier-3 shape, name it and inherit its anti-
patterns verbatim. Re-deriving it from raw Tier-2 patterns risks
rediscovering its failure modes the hard way.

## A1. PANEL (multi-lens deliberation)

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Microservices + API Gateway -- N specialized services
behind one entry point that synthesizes their outputs.

COMPOSES:
- B1 FAN-OUT + SYNTHESIZER (the topology)
- N x C2 PERSONA PRELOAD (one specialized lens per worker)
- S4 VALIDATION DECORATOR at the synthesis step (gates the verdict)
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO (the synthesis output is the plan artifact)

WHEN:
- A decision benefits from >=3 specialized lenses (security, cost,
  UX, architecture, etc.).
- The lenses are independent; no shared state during evaluation.
- The synthesis is itself a decision, not a concatenation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R[request] --> O[orchestrator]
  O --> L1[thread + persona A]
  O --> L2[thread + persona B]
  O --> L3[thread + persona C]
  L1 --> S[synthesis gate]
  L2 --> S
  L3 --> S
  S --> V[verdict]
```

REAL EXAMPLE: the `apm-review-panel` skill in `microsoft/apm`. See
`examples/02-review-panel-architecture.md` for the senior-engineer cautionary
tale of getting this shape wrong.

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- PANEL-WITHOUT-SYNTHESIS -- N lenses, then a concatenation. The user
  reads N reports instead of one decision. The synthesis IS the panel.
- PANEL-IN-ONE-CONTEXT -- running all N lenses sequentially in a
  single window. Each lens contaminates the next; later lenses inherit
  attention drift from earlier ones. The dominant failure mode for
  senior engineers stepping into agent design.
- IMBALANCED PANEL -- N-1 lenses agree, 1 dissents, the synthesis
  follows the majority without examining the dissent. The dissenting
  lens is usually the highest-information signal.

---

## A2. PIPELINE (Pipes-and-Filters)

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Pipes-and-Filters. A linear sequence of independent
filters, each transforming an input into an output for the next.

COMPOSES:
- B2 CONDITIONAL DISPATCH per stage (each stage may pick its
  procedure based on the prior stage's output class)
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO (each stage's output is persisted; the next stage
  reads from the artifact, not from in-context recall)
- S4 VALIDATION DECORATOR between stages (a stage's output is gated
  before the next stage consumes it)

WHEN:
- The work decomposes into ordered stages with verifiable hand-offs.
- Each stage has a different mental mode; mixing them produces noise.
- The PLAN / TASKS / IMPLEMENT decomposition is the canonical case.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R[request] --> S1[stage: plan]
  S1 --> G1{gate}
  G1 --> S2[stage: tasks]
  S2 --> G2{gate}
  G2 --> S3[stage: implement]
```

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- STAGE COLLAPSE -- "I will plan as I go". Planning and implementation
  in the same turn. The plan ends up post-hoc and un-falsifiable.
- INFINITE PLANNING -- a plan stage that never gates into tasks.
  `plan.md` grows; tasks never atomize; nothing ships.
- TASKS WITHOUT PLAN -- skipping the plan stage; atomizing directly
  from the request. The dependency graph is wrong; the critical path
  is invisible.

---

## A3. ORCHESTRATOR-SAGA

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Saga -- a long-lived multi-step transaction whose
steps are individually committed and individually compensable, with
an orchestrator coordinating the sequence.

COMPOSES:
- S3 ORCHESTRATOR FACADE (one entrypoint hides the multi-step
  topology from the dispatcher)
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO (every step's outcome is persisted so the saga
  can resume across spawns / sessions / failures)
- S4 VALIDATION DECORATOR at each step (a step that fails triggers
  compensation, not propagation)
- TRIGGER ORCHESTRATOR (substrate) for cross-session continuation

WHEN:
- Work spans more than one trigger event (PR opened, then comment,
  then merge, etc.).
- Steps must be individually durable; partial completion is meaningful
  state.
- Failure at step N requires compensation of steps 1..N-1, not a
  rerun from scratch.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  T1[trigger 1] --> S1[step 1] --> A1[(artifact 1)]
  A1 --> T2[trigger 2] --> S2[step 2] --> A2[(artifact 2)]
  A2 --> T3[trigger 3] --> S3[step 3] --> A3[(artifact 3)]
  S2 -. fail .-> C1[compensate step 1]
```

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- ANEMIC SAGA -- a saga whose steps have no compensation logic. On
  partial failure, the system is in an undefined state.
- IMPLICIT TRIGGER COUPLING -- assuming a future trigger will fire
  "soon enough". Without TRIGGER ORCHESTRATOR pinning the cadence,
  the saga stalls invisibly.

---

## A4. STAFFED PLAN

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Workflow Engine with role-bound tasks (a workflow
where each task names the role / capability that must execute it,
and the engine routes to the matching worker).

COMPOSES:
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO (the plan is durable)
- B7 TODO COMMAND (each task is a serialized command with a `staff`
  field naming the persona / skill)
- B2 CONDITIONAL DISPATCH per todo (the executor matches the
  staffing field to a loaded persona / skill)
- C4 DESCRIPTION DISPATCH when a todo's `staff` field names a skill
  the dispatcher must locate

WHEN:
- The plan has tasks that benefit from different lenses or skills
  (one task needs security review, another needs schema design,
  etc.).
- Each task is large enough that loading a specialized persona /
  skill pays for itself in output quality.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  P[plan.md]
  P --> T1[task 1<br/>staff: persona-A]
  P --> T2[task 2<br/>staff: skill-X]
  P --> T3[task 3<br/>staff: persona-B + skill-Y]
```

COMPOUNDING GAIN: a task with `staff: skill-X` realizes itself as
a CHILD-THREAD SPAWN that loads skill-X in a fresh context window.
Each task becomes both individually-staffed AND individually-isolated.

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- GOD-PERSONA -- one persona for every task. Defeats specialization;
  every task pays the same lens-loading cost regardless of fit.
- INLINE-PERSONA -- pasting persona content into the plan body
  instead of referencing it. The plan becomes a god module. Use the
  link; let the dispatcher load.

---

## A5. WAVE EXECUTION

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Build Pipeline with stages and gates (CI/CD).

COMPOSES:
- A2 PIPELINE (the spine)
- B3 SUPERVISOR per wave (decides what to spawn next within the wave)
- S4 VALIDATION DECORATOR between waves (a gate that determines
  whether the next wave's assumptions hold)
- B7 TODO COMMAND grouped by wave depth in the DAG

WHEN:
- The plan has a non-trivial task DAG.
- Tasks within a wave are independent; waves have ordering.
- Drift between waves is plausible enough that catching it late is
  expensive.

PROCEDURE:
1. Topologically sort the task DAG.
2. Group tasks at the same depth into a wave.
3. After each wave, run the gate: do the wave's outputs satisfy the
   assumptions the next wave depends on?
4. On gate failure, RE-PLAN FROM THE FAILED WAVE, not from the start.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  W1[wave 1<br/>tasks A,B] --> G1{gate 1}
  G1 -->|ok| W2[wave 2<br/>tasks C,D,E]
  G1 -->|fail| RP[re-plan]
  W2 --> G2{gate 2}
  G2 -->|ok| W3[wave 3<br/>task F]
  G2 -->|fail| RP
```

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- WAVE-WITHOUT-GATE -- topologically sorting tasks but not gating
  between waves. Drift compounds silently; failure surfaces at the
  end with no localizable cause.
- EVERY-TASK-IS-A-WAVE -- each task gets its own gate. Gates
  degenerate to noise; the supervisor pays orchestration cost for
  no parallelism win. Combine independent tasks into one wave.

---

## A6. EVENT-DRIVEN

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Event-Driven Architecture -- producers emit events;
handlers react asynchronously; loose coupling between them.

COMPOSES:
- TRIGGER ORCHESTRATOR (substrate) as the event surface
- Any Tier-2 mix as the handler body
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO when a handler must coordinate with another
  handler that fires later

WHEN:
- Work is reactive: PR opened -> review starts; comment with label
  -> follow-up runs; merge -> deploy fires.
- Handlers are loosely coupled; no handler knows the others by name.
- Cadence is event-driven, not time-driven.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  E1[event: PR opened] --> H1[handler: review skill]
  E2[event: comment with /retry] --> H2[handler: retry skill]
  E3[event: merge to main] --> H3[handler: deploy workflow]
  H1 -.writes.-> A[(plan / state)]
  H2 -.reads.-> A
```

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- IMPLICIT EVENT CHAINS -- a handler that assumes another handler
  fired first. Make the dependency explicit via a persisted artifact
  the second handler reads.
- EVENT FAN-OUT WITHOUT BUDGET -- one event triggering N handlers
  with no rate limit. Budget your concurrency.

---

## A7. ADVERSARIAL REVIEW (red-team + cold-reader gate)

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Code Review combined with Red Teaming. A produced
artifact is read by an INDEPENDENT reviewer whose only goal is to
break it -- find bugs, contradictions, missing cases, drift from goal.

COMPOSES:
- B1 FAN-OUT + SYNTHESIZER (each reviewer is a parallel thread)
- N x C2 PERSONA PRELOAD (specialist lenses + contrarian readers)
- THREAD SPAWN with FRESH CONTEXT (the reviewer must NOT see the
  producer's reasoning trace; only the artifact)
- S4 VALIDATION DECORATOR (the review verdict gates the next step)
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO (the review report becomes a persisted artifact)

WHEN:
- The producing thread has been working long enough that its own
  attention is biased toward "the answer I converged on".
- The artifact is consequential (a plan, a draft, a release call,
  a design doc). Cosmetic review is not enough.
- Cold-traffic conversion matters (a README, a PR description, an
  incident write-up): the producer cannot judge clarity for someone
  who lacks their context.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P[producer thread<br/>writes artifact] --> ART[(artifact)]
  ART --> RV1[reviewer 1<br/>fresh context<br/>persona A]
  ART --> RV2[reviewer 2<br/>fresh context<br/>persona B]
  ART --> CR[cold reader<br/>fresh context<br/>no producer trace]
  RV1 --> S[synthesis +<br/>verdict]
  RV2 --> S
  CR --> S
  S -->|GO| NEXT[next step]
  S -->|REFINE| P
```

SUB-PATTERN: COLD READER SIMULATION. At least one reviewer is a
non-specialist whose job is to read the artifact with NO producer
context, model the experience of a first-time reader, and report
where the artifact fails to land. Cold readers catch what specialists
ignore: vocabulary inflation, missing onboarding, buried payoff,
self-promotion. For cold-traffic surfaces (README, PR description,
public docs), this sub-pattern is mandatory, not optional.

REAL EXAMPLE: the genesis README iteration loop -- specialist
reviewers (genesis-expert, narrative-arc, funnel) plus four
contrarian developer personas (newcomer, skeptic, power user, OSS
maintainer) reading every draft cold. The cold readers caught
positioning failures that the specialists rated GO. See
`examples/01-readme-iteration.md` for the full walkthrough.

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- COSMETIC DISSENT -- reviewers all rate "GO with minor edits" with
  no dissent. The fan-out shape is decorative; the producer's bias
  passed through unchallenged. A real adversarial review produces
  at least one substantive challenge per round.
- RED TEAM WITHOUT TEETH -- a reviewer is briefed to find issues but
  the synthesis ignores their findings. The role is theatre. A
  GOAL STEWARD (B9) must arbitrate dissent explicitly.
- SINGLE READER -- one reviewer with one lens. By definition not
  adversarial; just a second opinion. Adversarial review needs N
  independent lenses.
- WARM-CONTEXT COLD READER -- the cold reviewer was given the
  producer's reasoning notes "for context". The reviewer is no
  longer cold; they inherit the producer's bias. Ban handoff of
  reasoning traces to cold readers; pass the artifact only.

---

## A8. ALIGNMENT LOOP (bounded iteration with goal steward)

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Bounded iteration with a stop condition + a
goal-validator role. Akin to controller-driven retry loops in
distributed systems, but the stop condition is "goal alignment"
rather than "byte-level convergence".

COMPOSES:
- A1 PANEL or A2 PIPELINE as the round body
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO (the goal + criteria persisted across rounds)
- B9 GOAL STEWARD (the steward arbitrates GO vs REFINE)
- A7 ADVERSARIAL REVIEW inside each round (contrarian readers
  prevent steward rubber-stamping)
- B10 HUMAN CHECKPOINT at the loop's bound (escalation when the
  loop runs out of rounds)
- A bounded round counter (typically 2-3 max)

WHEN:
- The first attempt is unlikely to satisfy the goal in one pass
  (creative work, positioning, complex synthesis).
- Goal drift is a real risk over several rounds.
- The producer cannot self-arbitrate convergence (steward needed).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  G[(GOAL +<br/>criteria,<br/>persisted)] --> R[round N body<br/>e.g. PANEL]
  R --> ART[round N artifact]
  ART --> AR[A7 adversarial<br/>review +<br/>cold readers]
  AR --> ST[B9 GOAL STEWARD<br/>arbitrates]
  ST -->|GO| END[ship]
  ST -->|REFINE| RC{round < max?}
  RC -->|yes| R
  RC -->|no| HC[B10 HUMAN<br/>CHECKPOINT]
  HC --> END2[human resolves]
```

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- UNBOUNDED LOOP -- no max rounds. Burns context and tokens
  indefinitely; never escalates to human. Always cap.
- STALE-CONTEXT REFINEMENT -- reusing the same producer thread
  across rounds, accumulating prior-round noise. Spawn a fresh
  thread per round; pass the goal artifact + the prior-round
  review report only.
- GOAL DRIFT (steward variant) -- the steward edits the goal to
  match emerging output instead of judging output against the goal.
  See B9 MOVING-GOALPOST STEWARD anti-pattern.
- LOOP WITHOUT STEWARD -- iterate without a named goal arbiter.
  Each round produces a different "improvement" with no stable
  target. The loop converges on noise, not goal.

---

## A9. SUPERVISED EXECUTION (plan, deterministic execute, verify)

CLASSICAL ANALOG: Plan-Execute-Verify with a controller; closer to
the Saga executor when the work has irreversible steps; closer to a
Build Orchestrator when steps are repeatable. The defining property
is that EXECUTION crosses out of the LLM layer into deterministic
substrate.

COMPOSES:
- B4 PLAN MEMENTO -- plan persists outside the execution thread so
  the verifier can re-read it without inheriting executor state.
- S7 DETERMINISTIC TOOL BRIDGE -- every consequential step runs
  through a typed tool, not LLM-asserted prose.
- S4 VALIDATION DECORATOR -- the verifier step is itself a
  deterministic check (another tool call against the system of
  record), NOT a second LLM pass.
- B10 HUMAN CHECKPOINT (optional but mandatory for irreversible
  effects) -- gates destructive tool calls before they run.
- A8 ALIGNMENT LOOP at the wrapping layer when the goal itself is
  not deterministic (e.g. "deploy successfully" with retries on
  recoverable failure).

WHEN:
- The work names a SYSTEM OF RECORD (db, repo, cluster, file
  system, payment processor, queue) and a CONSEQUENTIAL ACTION
  against it.
- Reliability and auditability matter more than expressive
  flexibility.
- The action is irreversible OR triggers downstream effects you
  cannot easily roll back.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  G[(GOAL +<br/>plan,<br/>persisted<br/>B4)] --> P[LLM: plan step<br/>compose tool calls]
  P --> CHK[B10 human<br/>checkpoint?]
  CHK -->|approve| T[(TOOL<br/>S7 bridge<br/>CLI / script / MCP / API)]
  CHK -->|reject| END1[abort, escalate]
  T ==> R[(RESULT<br/>structured)]
  R --> V[(TOOL<br/>verifier<br/>S4 deterministic)]
  V ==> OK{verify pass?}
  OK -->|yes| DONE[ship]
  OK -->|no| RETRY{retry budget?}
  RETRY -->|yes| P
  RETRY -->|no| END2[abort, escalate]
```

(Double-line `==>` edges denote tool-call results crossing into the
LLM's next inference step; thin edges are LLM-internal control flow.
See `mermaid-conventions.md`.)

ANTI-PATTERNS:
- PLAN-AND-PRAY -- plan is composed; execution is left as LLM
  prose ("now apply the migration ..."). The migration never
  actually runs; the LLM emits a plausible-looking success
  message. Always bridge consequential steps via S7.
- VERIFY-WITH-LLM-ONLY -- after a tool call, the verification step
  asks the LLM "did it work?" and trusts its answer. The LLM
  cannot read present state; verification must be another tool
  call against the system of record.
- UNCHECKPOINTED IRRECOVERABLE -- a destructive tool call (DROP,
  force push, delete bucket, payment) without a B10 HUMAN
  CHECKPOINT or a deterministic precondition gate. The selection
  is still LLM-owned; one fabricated parameter and the action is
  done.
- HARNESS-LLM CONFLATION (architectural variant) -- the design
  describes "the agent runs the migration". Redraw with the bridge
  explicit: the LLM SELECTS the migration; the harness EXECUTES it
  via a deterministic tool; the LLM INTERPRETS the result. Three
  steps, two layers.
- TOOLLESS PRECONDITION -- the design gates the destructive call
  on a fact ("only if branch is main") and reads that fact from
  LLM recall instead of from a tool call. The gate is theatre.
  Bridge the precondition.

SELECTION HEURISTIC: If the design's outcome is "X actually
happened in system Y" (not "we claim X happened"), this is the
shape. Pick A9 over plain A2 PIPELINE when at least one stage is a
consequential side effect; A9 over A8 ALIGNMENT LOOP when the
convergence criterion is a deterministic state, not goal alignment.

## How Tier-3 patterns compose with each other

Tier-3 patterns are not mutually exclusive. The canonical senior-
engineer plan combines several:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R[request] --> A2
  subgraph A2["A2 PIPELINE: plan / tasks / implement"]
    direction LR
    PLAN[plan stage] --> TASKS[tasks stage]
    TASKS --> IMPL[implement stage]
  end
  PLAN -. invokes .-> A1[A1 PANEL<br/>for plan decisions]
  TASKS -. uses .-> A4[A4 STAFFED PLAN<br/>per todo]
  IMPL -. uses .-> A5[A5 WAVE EXECUTION<br/>across the DAG]
  A2 --> END[B5 ACCEPTANCE OBSERVER<br/>final gate]
```

A2 PIPELINE shapes the macro stages. A4 STAFFED PLAN fills task slots
in the tasks stage. A5 WAVE EXECUTION runs the implement stage when
the DAG warrants it. B5 ACCEPTANCE OBSERVER (a Tier-2 behavioral
pattern) closes the work. A1 PANEL plugs into any stage that needs
deliberation rather than single-lens judgement.

---

## Selection heuristic

```
need >=3 specialized lenses with a synthesis decision?
  -> A1 PANEL

work decomposes into ordered stages with verifiable hand-offs?
  -> A2 PIPELINE

work spans multiple trigger events; partial completion meaningful?
  -> A3 ORCHESTRATOR-SAGA

plan exists; tasks benefit from per-task staffing?
  -> A4 STAFFED PLAN

task DAG is non-trivial; drift between waves is expensive?
  -> A5 WAVE EXECUTION

work is reactive to events from outside the agent?
  -> A6 EVENT-DRIVEN

artifact is consequential and producer is biased by long context?
  -> A7 ADVERSARIAL REVIEW (always layer COLD READER for cold-
     traffic surfaces)

work is creative, multi-round, with goal-drift risk?
  -> A8 ALIGNMENT LOOP (bound the rounds; steward + cold readers)

work names a consequential side effect or a fact that must be true
(deploy, migrate, delete, post, compute, verify a system fact)?
  -> A9 SUPERVISED EXECUTION (plan -> deterministic tool -> verify)
```

When two patterns fit, prefer the one that gives each thread a
narrower context (fewer competing tokens). When two architectural
patterns fit equally, consult `pattern-tradeoffs.md` and cite the
matrix in your handoff packet.
