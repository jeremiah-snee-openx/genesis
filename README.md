`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md` -- these files are the code that steers your AI coding agents. Genesis is a design discipline for that code: decomposition, contracts, and refactor moves -- plus two patterns with no classical counterpart, because LLM attention decays with distance.

## Install

```bash
apm install danielmeppiel/genesis
```

Genesis ships through [apm](https://github.com/microsoft/apm), a package manager for AI agent primitives. Adapters cover Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, and Codex (see [Runtimes](#runtimes)).

## You've felt this

If you've built anything non-trivial with AI coding agents, one of these has happened to you:

- **The instruction file that grew teeth.** Your `CLAUDE.md` (or `.cursor/rules`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) was forty lines. It is now four hundred. The agent ignores half of it and you cannot tell which half. (The prompt-sprawl anti-pattern.)
- **Great at turn one, confidently wrong by turn twenty.** Early constraints slid out of attention as later notes piled up. Re-pasting holds for two turns, then drifts again.
- **The same paragraph in four places.** A convention copy-pasted across a skill, an instruction file, and a slash command. You edited one of them last week. The agent now contradicts itself depending on which one fires.

The industry sells "best practices" for AI coding agents -- prompt tips, rule-file templates, instruction snippets. What is missing is **architecture**: the named components, the seams between them, the patterns that govern their dynamics, the contracts at their boundaries, the refactor moves when they drift. Software engineering needed architecture, not just style guides, the moment systems crossed a complexity threshold. AI-coding-agent systems crossed that threshold a while ago. Genesis is the architectural layer that was missing.

---

## Quick Start

After install, open the AI tool you use (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) and paste this prompt verbatim:

```
Use the genesis-architect persona to design a skill that reviews my pull requests for missing
tests, undocumented public API, and unsafe migrations. Apply the full architect's loop: goal,
primitives, pattern, UML, acceptance, plan.
```

You will get a named pattern, an execution-shape diagram, an acceptance test, and a written plan -- before any skill file is touched. That design output is what genesis produces.

> **Claude Code shortcut:** `@genesis-architect Use genesis to design...`  For other harnesses, see [Runtimes](#runtimes).

<details>
<summary>What does the genesis-architect persona look like?</summary>

[Read the source: genesis-architect.agent.md](agents/genesis-architect.agent.md). A role declaration, the eight loop steps as standing instructions, and a severity rubric per step -- not a vague "you are an expert" prompt.

## What it produces

A common ask:

> *"Use the genesis-architect persona to design a skill that reviews my PRs -- checking for missing tests, undocumented public API, and unsafe migrations."*

Genesis produces this **before** writing any file.

**GOAL.** One reviewer that flags missing tests, undocumented public API, and unsafe migrations on a PR diff.

**PRIMITIVES.**
- `Module Entrypoint` -- the `pr-review` skill itself.
- `Child-Thread Spawn` x 3 -- one per lens (tests, docs, migrations), each in a fresh context window.
- `Plan Persistence` -- findings written to `pr-review.md` so a re-run on the same PR is comparable.

**PATTERN.** Master-Worker (genesis name: Fan-Out + Synthesizer). The parent spawns one worker per lens, each in a fresh context window. Independent inquiries with no shared state should never compete in the same window -- later lenses inherit attention drift from earlier ones.

**ACCEPTANCE.** On a PR with one missing test, one undocumented export, and a benign migration: the output names exactly two findings (no false positive on the migration), each citing the file path.

**PLAN.** `pr-review.md` written first. Only then does the agent author the skill, the persona, and the rule files.

The file you eventually author is the easy part.

## Same skill, three prompts, three architectures (and why)

Three cold-load runs of the genesis skill -- same skill, fresh context each time, three different operator prompts -- yielded three materially different (and each justified) output architectures:

| Operator prompt (excerpt) | Output shape | Patterns selected (and rejected) | Worked example |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Draft release notes from CHANGELOG entries" | 6 files: 1 skill + 2 assets + 3 scripts; single thread | A9 Supervised Execution + S7 Bridge + S4 Schema Gate. A1 Panel **rejected** (lens-count gate did not fire). | [examples/03](examples/03-release-notes-single-skill.md) |
| "Review every PR: gather findings and present them" | 17 primitives: 6 personas + 4 assets + 3 scripts + trigger + entrypoint + rule + evals | A6 Event-Driven + A1 Panel + Dissent-Weighted arbiter. R1 Split considered, applied at lens content as R3 Extract. | [examples/04](examples/04-pr-review-advisory.md) |
| "Review every PR: emit APPROVE or REJECT verdict" | 9 primitives + S7 deterministic bridges + S4 schema gate + post-emit verifier loop + graceful tool probes | Regime change: A9 + S7 + S4 hardened. A8 Alignment Loop, B5 Escalation, R1 Split all **considered and rejected with WHEN-clause grounding**. | [examples/05](examples/05-pr-review-verdict.md) |

Notice row 3: removing the operator's "gather and present, never decide" constraint flipped the system from advisory to consequential. Genesis hardened the existing pipeline with deterministic bridges and a verifier loop -- it did **not** reach for new orchestration patterns. That restraint, with its rejection logic shown, is the discipline being demonstrated. Each example is the verbatim output of a fresh agent session that loaded only `SKILL.md` and the operator prompt.

## The architect's role, ported

The six decisions a software architect makes map to AI-coding-agent systems row for row. The code is Markdown; the runtime is an LLM; the structural failure modes are the same.

| Classical concern | Agent-architect equivalent | Genesis deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| Greenfield design | Partition a goal into agents, skills, and instruction scopes; define execution boundaries | Skill dependency graph + handoff packet + `plan.md` |
| Service decomposition | Identify where one agent ends and another begins; prevent skill coupling | Primitive dependency graph + R1 Split when seams drift |
| Integration and contracts | Design skill inputs, outputs, and agent-to-agent handoffs | Interface sketch (trigger, inputs, outputs) + sequence diagram |
| Cross-cutting concerns | Auth context, safety rails, encoding rules that apply across all agents | Shared Scope-Attached Rule Files + Rule Bridge pattern |
| Refactoring strategy | Identify drifted skills and conflicting instruction files; pay prompt debt | Skill refactor plan using R1-R4 patterns ([refactor-patterns.md](assets/refactor-patterns.md)) |
| Architecture review | Evaluate proposed designs for consistency; prevent prompt sprawl | Panel pattern (multi-lens review) + severity-rubric compliance check |

---

## Primitives

Every harness implements the same six concepts under different folder names. Genesis names them once so the vocabulary outlives any one tool.

| Concept | What it is | Common terms |
|---|---|---|
| Persona Scoping File | A document loaded at session start to scope who the agent is. | "agent file", "subagent", "mode" |
| Module Entrypoint | A bundled, self-contained capability with assets and a contract. | "skill", "module" |
| Scope-Attached Rule File | A constraint that auto-applies to a path or context. | "instruction", "rule", "memory" |
| Child-Thread Spawn | A primitive that creates a new context window running in parallel. | "subagent thread", "Task tool" |
| Trigger Orchestrator | A declarative pipeline that runs primitives on events. | "workflow", "hook", "automation" |
| Plan Persistence | A stable artifact (file or DB) holding the active plan across turns. | "plan.md", "TODO state", "checkpoints" |

These names are deliberately generic. The architecture must outlive any one tool.

## Patterns

Genesis maps the Gang-of-Four onto agent design. The classical name is your Rosetta Stone; the AI-native name encodes the LLM-physics specifics (context isolation, attention decay).

| GoF axis | Classical | AI-native | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Creational | Factory Method | Thread Spawn | Work benefits from a fresh context window |
| Structural | Facade | Orchestrator Facade | A multi-step capability needs to look like one signature |
| Behavioral | Master-Worker | Fan-Out + Synthesizer | >=3 independent lenses, no shared state |
| Behavioral | *(no analog)* | **Attention Anchor** | Re-inject goal + constraints at every re-grounding boundary |

**Attention Anchor has no classical counterpart -- it exists because LLM attention degrades over distance.** Without periodic re-injection of goal and hard constraints, long sessions silently drift from the original intent. It is the highest-leverage behavioral pattern for any non-trivial agent task.

Full catalogue (19 design patterns + 6 architectural patterns + 4 refactor patterns): [`assets/design-patterns.md`](assets/design-patterns.md), [`assets/architectural-patterns.md`](assets/architectural-patterns.md), [`assets/refactor-patterns.md`](assets/refactor-patterns.md).

## The architect's loop

```
1.  STATE GOAL          --> one sentence, observable outcome
2.  NAME PRIMITIVES     --> which substrate concepts will you use?
3.  PICK PATTERN        --> architectural shape, then design patterns; justify in one line
3.5 COMPOSE OR BUILD?   --> can an existing module satisfy this?
4.  DRAW UML            --> mermaid, validate it renders
5.  ACCEPTANCE          --> what proves it works?
6.  PERSIST PLAN        --> write plan.md (or equivalent) BEFORE coding
7.  IMPLEMENT           --> author files; commit
7b. RELOAD PLAN         --> on every meaningful turn, re-read the plan
8.  STOP CONDITION      --> ship, or stop the design
```

Steps 6 and 7b are non-negotiable. They realize **Plan Memento** (state outside the context window) and **Attention Anchor** (re-inject goal + constraints on every meaningful turn). Together they defeat the silent drift that ends most long agent sessions.

The primitives are the same. Only the file names change.
